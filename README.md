# GAME_PROGRAM-EX--2

# EX 2 : Create a player movement using character, collectable, player health and score 
# NAME : V M KAVIYA

# Aim

Create a playable third-person character in Unreal Engine that can move and run, collect coin-like collectibles, track a Score and Player Health, and display both on-screen (UI). 

---

# Overview:

1. **Player Character (BP_PlayerCharacter)** — handles movement, input, health, and overlaps with collectables.
2. **Collectable (BP_Collectable)** — simple actor with collision that gives score (and optionally health) when overlapped.
3. **UI (WBP_HUD)** — UMG Widget showing Score and Health values.
4. **GameMode / PlayerState** — (optional) hold persistent Score/HighScore across respawns.
5. **Game flow** — pickup increments Score, maybe plays sound/particle and destroys the collectable; health decreases on damage, and player dies or respawns when health ≤ 0.

# Step-by-step Implementation (Blueprint-first)

## 1. Project & Input Setup

* Create a Third Person Blueprint project (or use your existing ThirdPersonMap).
* Open **Project Settings → Input** and ensure these mappings exist:

  * **MoveForward** (W / Up arrow)
  * **MoveRight** (A/D or Left/Right)
  * **Turn** / **LookUp** (mouse)
  * **Jump** (SpaceBar)
  * **Run** (Left Shift) — optional if you want sprint

## 2. Player Character Blueprint (BP_PlayerCharacter)

1. Duplicate the existing `ThirdPersonCharacter` (or create a new `Character` blueprint) and name it `BP_PlayerCharacter`.
2. Variables to add (Expose where useful):

   * **Score** (Integer) — default 0
   * **MaxHealth** (Float) — e.g. 100.0
   * **Health** (Float) — default equal to MaxHealth
   * **bIsRunning** (Boolean) — if you want sprinting
3. Movement (in Event Graph):

   * Use `Add Movement Input` hooked to `MoveForward` and `MoveRight` axis mappings.
   * Use `Turn` and `LookUp` to rotate camera.
   * If using Run: on `Run` Pressed set `Max Walk Speed` on the Character Movement component (e.g. 1200) and reset on Released (600 default).
4. Health functions:

   * **Function: ApplyDamage(float DamageAmount)**

     * Subtract `DamageAmount` from `Health`.
     * If `Health <= 0` → call `OnDeath` event (disable input, play animation, respawn or show Game Over).
     * Update HUD (call event to update widget binding).
   * **Function: AddHealth(float HealAmount)**

     * Add to `Health` but clamp to `MaxHealth`.
     * Update HUD.
5. Score management:

   * **Function: AddScore(int Amount)**

     * `Score = Score + Amount` → update HUD.

## BP_Collectable → OnComponentBeginOverlap (Sphere)

* Other Actor → Cast To BP_PlayerCharacter
* Branch (if cast success)

  * Call `AddScore(ScoreValue)` on Player Character
  * If `GiveHealth > 0` Call `AddHealth(GiveHealth)`
  * Play Sound at Location
  * Spawn Emitter at Location
  * Destroy Actor

## BP_PlayerCharacter → AddScore (Custom Event)

* Input: Amount (int)
* Score = Score + Amount
* Call `UpdateScoreDisplay` on the HUD widget reference
* (Optional) Play pickup sound, animate, or show floating text

## BP_PlayerCharacter → ApplyDamage (Custom Event)

* Input: Damage (float)
* Health = Health - Damage
* If Health <= 0

  * Call `OnDeath` (Disable Input; show Game Over)
* Update HUD: Call `UpdateHealthDisplay`

# RESULT :

The AI character successfully roams within the defined NavMesh area, choosing random destinations at intervals using the Behavior Tree logic.
